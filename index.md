<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/felipe2.jpg" width="120">{: .image-pull-right}  My name is **Luis Felipe Ventorim Ferrão** and I'm a **Research Assistant Scientist** at the University of Florida, working in collaboration with Dr. Patricio Munoz at the [Blueberry Breeding and Genomics Lab](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/). You can read more about my work on this webpage and also see codes, papers, class notes and talks associated with my research.

## Goals

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/all.png" />
</p>

My main goal is to explore a wide variety of problems at the interface of Statistics and Genetics. It includes developing novel methods and software or learning something new compared with existing approaches. Results are mainly applicable in two crops (blueberry and coffee) and in two directions: the use of multi-omic data for (i) prediction and (ii) understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.


## Specific areas

- Association Mapping (GWAS)
- Genomic Prediction
- Linkage and QTL mapping
- Bayesian Inference
- Metabolomics and Sensory Analysis
- Blueberry Breeding
- Coffee Breeding

## Coffee Research Topics

### Motivation

Coffee is a widely consumed beverage that drives a vibrant industry.  Despite this importance, its sustainability is facing critical challenges including price volatility, limited access to genetic resources, the presence of new diseases, and, in particular, accelerated climate changes. Genomic research in coffee could unveil crucial insights into the plant’s biological characteristics, including disease resistance, yield potential, and quality attributes. Some important projects led by the University of Florida

### Flavor to Cup (F2C)

<img src="{{ site.url }}./coffee_logo.png" width="220">{: .image-pull-right}  Innovation is one of the key aspects for the future of the coffee chain. We believe that investigating new genomic tools  could leverage the development of a new generation of climate-smart coffee cultivars that combine flavor and are more resilient to projected climate changes. 
- Goals: 
  + Assembly a high-quality _C. canephora_ reference genome
  + Dissect the genetic architecture of flavor-related traits
  + Combine sensory, metabolomics and genomics into a single framework for molecular breeding
- Collaborators: 
  + Incaper (Brazil)
  + Denise Tieman (University of Florida)
  + Patricio Munoz (University of Florida)
  + Marcio Resende Jr. (University of Florida)
  + Christophe Montagon (RD2 vision)

### Breeding for Climate-Smart Coffee Cultivars


<img src="{{ site.url }}./coffee_logo2.png" width="220">{: .image-pull-right}  Breeding for climate-smart coffee cultivars is a research initiative with the fundamental goal to support local coffee production. The underlying question is: could coffee be an alternative crop for local growers in Florida? If so, where and how?

- Objective: leveraging flavor analyses by using Artificial Intelligence methods
- Goals:
  + Can we have a better understanding of consumer preferences by combining traditional sensory panel evaluations and computer vision?
  + From a statistical standpoint, how are the main chemical components acting (and interacting) to create flavor preferences?
- Funding: Launching Innovative Faculty Teams in AI (LIFT AI)
- Collaborators: 
  + Raquel Dias (University of Florida)
  + Denise Tieman (University of Florida)
  + Charles A. Sims (University of Florida)
  + Marcio Resende Jr. (University of Florida)
  +  Patricio Munoz (University of Florida)
