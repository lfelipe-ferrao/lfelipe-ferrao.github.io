## Course Description

During our lunch time (Tuesday 11:45-12:35pm and Thursday 11:45-1:40 pm) we will discuss some vibrant topics underlying the routine of modern breeding programs. Survey of Breeding Tools and Methods (HOS 6932) is an introductory class at the [UF/IFA Plant Breeding](https://programs.ifas.ufl.edu/plant-breeding/graduate-program/) graduate course. The intent of the course is to help students understand the breadth of disciplines in the vibrant field of plant breeding. The course will be taught by experts using these techniques and methods in their plant breeding. I am the instructor of the **Quantitative Genetics and Genomic Selection** module.

# Class notes and Hands-on

It is an attempt to organize and make available to any student the class notes used during the Quantitative Genetic course. The material is a compilation of texts, examples, and materials from multiple books and papers that we visited to create the classes. We suggest using it as a guide for lessons. *Important: these class notes do not replace the fundamental role of the textbooks !!* At the end of each topic, there are references. We suggest that you visit the references for a complete understanding. Finally, we hope in the future include more authorial examples using data from our personal research.
