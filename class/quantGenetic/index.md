## Course Description

Advanced training in quantitative genetics is critical for success of the modern breeder. This course addresses this need both from a theoretical and applied perspective. PCB 6555 Introduction to Quantitative Genetics will be based on lectures and hands-on activities that utilize the content learned in class. The course is intended for students of all disciplines who are interested in quantitative genetic principles and biometric evaluation of characters that exhibit continuous variation in natural populations and breeding programs for animals and/or plants.

## Course Objectives
The course goal is to introduce graduate students to concepts, theory and methods in quantitative genetics with emphasis in application to breeding programs and statistical analysis of genetic experiments/studies.

## Required and Recommended Literature

- Isik, F., Holland, J., Maltecca, C. - Genetic Data Analysis for Plant and Animal Breeding. (2017).
DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-55177-7

- Genetics and analysis of quantitative traits, Lynch and Walsh, Sinauer, 1998

## Software

**You will need to bring your own laptop.** The main software used will be R with a library for ASReml-R. R
can be downloaded from www.r-project.org, and ASReml (R library and stand-alone version) is available
for registered students from: www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml/asreml-teching. You will receive
instructions to download, install and you will require a license for this software that will be provided by
the instructor. There are numerous online resources available for R; however, if you would like a
traditional textbook, The R Book, is widely available and comprehensive.

# Class notes and Hands-on

It is an attempt to organize and make available to any student the class notes used during the Quantitative Genetic course. The material is a compilation of texts, examples, and materials from multiple books and papers that we visited to create the classes. We suggest using it as a guide for lessons. *Important: these class notes do not replace the fundamental role of the textbooks !!* At the end of each topic, there are references. We suggest that you visit the references for a complete understanding. Finally, we hope in the future include more authorial examples using data from our personal research.
