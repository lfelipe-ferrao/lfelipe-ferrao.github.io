She has a PhD degree (2017) at University of São Paulo (ESALQ/USP), in which she worked with development of statistical models in genomic selection considering allele dosage for autotetraploid species, with applications in *Panicum maximum*. In 2016 she was a visitor Scholar at North Carolina State University (NCSU, USA), supervised by Professor Zhao-Bang Zeng, where she compared the accuracy of prediction models using pseudodiploid and tetraploid dosage. She was a postdoctor in the Lab until 2019, where she worked with linkage and QTL mapping in *P. maximum* and collaboratied with genetic mapping studies in *Brachiaria decumbens* (tetraploid), *B. humidicola* (hexaploid), and sugarcane. She has concentrated her studies in quantitative genetics of polyploids, computing for statistical genetics (especially in R software) and mixed models.

#### Maria Izabel Cavassim Alves (by herself)

_**Maria Izabel**_ is an Agronomist and was an intern in our group. Currently she is a master student in Bioinformatics at Aarhus University (Denmark) (birc.au.uk). She has been taken courses related to Population genetics, Computer Science and Statistics. The integration of interdisciplinary fields is what motivates her. Currently she is involved in the 'NCHAIN project' which aims to study the interactions of Rhizobium and Clover within the nitrogen-chain in order to increase the amount of nitrogen fixed per hectare of organic clover. The path towards this goal goes through systematic examination of the phenotypic relationship between the yield of clover-grass crops and comprehension of the genetic architecture behind the interactions (intra- and interspecific).
