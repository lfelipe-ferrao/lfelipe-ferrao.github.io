#### Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia

_**Augusto**_ is the Faculty responsible for the Lab.
He is also responsible for maintaining this web page. His professional
web page is
[http://augusto-garcia.github.io/](http://augusto-garcia.github.io/).
For more information about him on the web, check his

Augusto's research goals include having a better understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, through linkage and QTL mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection. Most of his activities involve sugarcane, a complex autopolyploid species that does not fully benefit from molecular markers technology, but many other plant species have also been studied.

He is also an enthusiastic of free software, and has been using Linux for many years. He strongly supports and encourage the usage of R,
Emacs, LaTeX, and git, among many other software and tools.

## Postdocs

#### Kaio Olímpio das Graças Dias (by himself)

_**Kaio**_ has an undergraduate degree in Agronomy (2010) and Master degree (2013) and PhD (2016) in Genetics and Plant Breeding at Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Kaio.jpg" height="100">{: .image-pull-right}

In 2010, he was at University of Minnesota as a trainee. As PhD candidate, he was a visitor Scholar at University of Florida in 2015, working in a statistical-genetics model for genotype-by-environment interaction for genome wide selection analysis. He has experience in plant breeding, quantitative genetics, linear mixed models and genome wide selection. His currently work is about quantitative genetics, linear mixed model and bayesian approach applied to plant breeding.
